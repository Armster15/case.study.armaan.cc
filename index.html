<h2>Armaan&#39;s Case Studies for Serious Studying and Totally NOT for Rickrolling Unsuspecting People</h2>

<p><iframe height="30" id="iframe" onload="readfile()" scrolling="no" src="rickrollCounter.html" style="overflow:hidden" width="500"></iframe></p>

<p>Hello! You are probably here because you saw someone use this domain (http://case.study.armaan.cc) and wanted to see what the heck this website does.<br />
<br />
Well this website is designed to rickroll people! People nowadays are intelligent creatures and don&#39;t fall for silly YouTube links. This is for solving the problem!<br />
<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>How to use this tool</h3>

<p>It&#39;s actually really simple! Just do the following:<br />
<code>http://case.study.armaan.cc/x</code><br />
Now replace the <code>x</code> with the string of words you want for the URL!</p>

<h3>Example URLs</h3>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://case.study.armaan.cc/news/3000-People-Just-Died"><code>http://case.study.armaan.cc/news/3000-People-Just-Died</code></a></li>
	<li><a href="http://case.study.armaan.cc/MathTestAnswers"><code>http://case.study.armaan.cc/MathTestAnswers</code></a></li>
	<li><a href="http://case.study.armaan.cc/MyNewWebsite"><code>http://case.study.armaan.cc/MyNewWebsite</code></a></li>
</ul>

<h3>How it Works</h3>

<p>Well, it&#39;s pretty simple. You know what 404 pages are, right?<br />
If you don&#39;t they are pages that tell you that a page doesn&#39;t exist.<br />
<br />
Here are a few 404 page examples</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.apple.com/This-Page-Does-Not-Exist">https://www.apple.com/This-Page-Does-Not-Exist</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/This-Page-Does-Not-Exist">https://www.microsoft.com/This-Page-Does-Not-Exist</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.armaan.cc/This-Page-Does-Not-Exist">https://www.armaan.cc/This-Page-Does-Not-Exist</a></li>
</ul>

<p><br />
So these pages redirect you to a page in which it tells you that page doesn&#39;t exist.<br />
<br />
This website has a 404 page as well. But while the websites above have a proper 404 page, this webpage&#39;s 404 page redirects you to Rick Astley&#39;s Never Gonna Give You Up. If you are curious what the 404 file is called, its called <code>rickroll.php</code> and can be accessed at <code><a href="http://case.study.armaan.cc/rickroll.php">http://case.study.armaan.cc/rickroll.php</a></code>. If you want to view the code of the 404 page, see Nerd Land.</p>
